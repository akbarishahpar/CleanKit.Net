# CleanKit.Net

**CleanKit.Net** is a lightweight and modular framework for building scalable, maintainable, and testable applications using **Clean Architecture** principles in **ASP.NET Core** and **C#**.

It provides a well-structured starting point for enterprise-grade solutions by enforcing separation of concerns between layers such as Presentation, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure.
